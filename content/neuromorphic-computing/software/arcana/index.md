## Overview

ARCANA is a library built on PyTorch that provides a simulation model of the DYNAP-SE hardware.

The README gives the equations of the DPI neuron implemented in DYNAP-SE, including an adaptation current responsible for spike-frequency adaptation and a positive-feedback current. ARCANA also simulates the synapse types that DYNAP-SE implements: AMPA and NMDA (excitatory) and GABAa and GABAb (inhibitory). The NMDA synapse is additionally voltage-gated.

The README quickstart creates a single neuron and trains its leakage and gain currents with the Adam optimizer so that it reaches a target output firing rate.

### Getting started
ARCANA is installed from GitHub with `pip install git+https://github.com/ferqui/ARCANA.git`. Documentation is available at [dynapsetorch.readthedocs.io](https://dynapsetorch.readthedocs.io/).
